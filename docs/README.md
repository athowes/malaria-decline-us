* [report](https://athowes.github.io/malaria-decline-us/report.pdf): short report on analysis so far
* [time-series](https://athowes.github.io/malaria-decline-us/time-series.pdf): county-level time series
* [time-series-state](https://athowes.github.io/malaria-decline-us/time-series-state.pdf): state-level time series
* [time-series-state-predictions](https://athowes.github.io/malaria-decline-us/time-series-state-predictions.pdf): separate plots by state of time series predictions
* [smoothed-esimates](https://athowes.github.io/malaria-decline-us/smoothed-esimates.pdf): separate cloropleths by year of predictions n.b. the initial "19" should be removed, originally I had years as "45" but then I moved to "1945" hence this error which will be fixed after a rerun. Edit: this file is too large to host on GH
